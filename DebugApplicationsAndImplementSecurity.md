# 3 Debug Applications and Implement Security

## 3.1 Validate Application Input

### Why Validating your Data is Important
- Normally most of the data put into your system comes from users.
- There are two types of user
  - Innocent Users
  - Malicious Users
- You must validate data that is input into your system to avoid your application from crashing and stopping your data from becoming corrupted

### Managing Data Integrity

There are four kinds of data integrity:
- Entity: each entity should be uniquely identifiable
- Domain: is the data within a valid range
- Referential: the relationships the data type have with each other
- User Defined: comprises specific rules that you need to define for example a customer not being able to place an order below a certain dollar amount
